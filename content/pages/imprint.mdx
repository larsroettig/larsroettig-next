## DISCLAIMER

### LIABILITY FOR CONTENT:

According to § 7, para. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) we, as a service provider, are responsible for the content of these pages under general law. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged, however, to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability may be assumed only from the date of knowledge of a concrete violation. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

## LIABILITY FOR LINKS:

Our website contains links to external websites of third parties, over which we have no control. We, therefore, cannot provide any guarantee regarding such external content. The provider or operator of such websites is always responsible for the content of the linked sites. The linked sites were checked at the time of linking for potential legal violations, and no illegal content was identified. However, permanent monitoring of the linked pages is unreasonable without any concrete evidence of a violation. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove such links immediately.

## COPYRIGHT LAW:

The content and works published on these pages by the service provider are subject to German copyright law. The duplication, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of the copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. If the content was not created by the website operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular, content of third parties is marked as such. If you become aware of any copyright infringements, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove the content immediately.

## ONLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

The European Commission is providing an online platform for dispute resolution. Just check out the link https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. Neither are we legally obliged nor voluntarily willing to take part in a dispute settlement, particularly as our offer addresses entrepreneurs exclusively.
