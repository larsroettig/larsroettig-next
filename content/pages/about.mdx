# Hello, my name is Lars

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
 <div className="col-span-2">
I am a Senior Software Engineer at TechDivision GmbH. A digital agency focused on Magento and modern web development.
I have over seven years of E-Commerce development experience working with different clients over the world.
I am also a fan of contemporary web development, including new browser capabilities PWA (progressive web apps) based on React.

I am currently part of a Team and work on really Big E-Commerce with a Team of Developers, Product Owner, and Software Architects. I am also part of Magento PWA Core Team as Maintainer.

In 2019 and 2020, I was on loan to an American company remote as a developer for a total of 12 months.
There I took over the team lead position.

I like to bask in natureâ€™s glory right here in the south of Bavaria in my free time. I also enjoy cycling, hiking or sometimes relax somewhere to free the mind and gain new ideas.
