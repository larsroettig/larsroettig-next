Before we start, I want to provide a short overview of the PWA Studio architecture. With Magento PWA Studio, we should have the opportunity to build a complex Progressive Web Applications on top of Magento 2. Can we already realize **real** customer **projects** with PWA Studio? I would like to have a look at that with you. This blog post will be updated at regular intervals.
The Magento Core Team selected **React** ( **JavaScript** ), **GraphQL** , **CSS Modules** as the leading technologies to build this theme from scratch.

Magento PWA Studio uses a Monorepo structure.
For those reasons, after checkout, we already see ten subfolders.
They packages are most likely unrelated, loosely connected, or connected.
To give an example, **venia-ui** needs elements from **peregrine**. Let&#39;s take a look at which components we have in the current state.

**Main Libraries**
If we start our a PWA-Project, we mostly change components from these two libraries to have our own PWA theme.

- **peregrine** - A component library for adding logic to visual elements
- **venia-ui** - Library of React Component for PWA storefront projects

**Elements for building**

- **pwa-buildpack** - A tooling library to help with PWA storefront development
- **upward-spec** - UPWARD specification and test suite
- **upward-js** - A reference implementation of the UPWARD specification
- **babel-preset-peregrine** - A babel preset plugin that is required to use peregrine components
- **graphql-cli-validate-magento-pwa-queries** - A script to validate your project&#39;s GraphQL queries against a schema

**Other elements**

- **venia-styleguide** - The style guide for venia components
- **venia-concept** - A concept storefront project built using PWA Studio tools
- **pwa-devdocs** - Source for the documentation site ([http://pwastudio.io/](http://pwastudio.io/))

## Current features in PWA Studio version 5.0

Currently, the PWA Studio offers a small collection of tools and components.
For me, it is a library that allows building a custom PWA Theme for Magento.

### Summary

Although the project is still in an early stage of development, the PWA Studio already offers a toolkit for creating a PWA theme. Due to the lack of extension points and multilingualism, you will have to write many React extensions yourself, which can make large projects very complicated and expensive.
With build things from scratch, it is possible to ignore legacy problems and create new great ideas. On the other hand, it takes a long time to get a stable software anyway with a production-ready feature set.
From my point of view, it is good to now with a small project to gather experience with the new PWA Studio even there are already a few bigger projects live.
