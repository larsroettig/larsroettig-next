After the covid-related break, the React Advanced is coming back on October 22-23, 2021, with a hybrid format. From my point of view, 2019 was a great lineup. So stay tuned and wait for the lineup 2021, but I hear it will be fantastic.
It bost my React knowledge so much. I was watching all talks on YouTube. Here you can find the entire playlist with much good content.
