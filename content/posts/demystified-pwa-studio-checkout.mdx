<Callout type={'warning'}>
The Blogpost is based Check / Money Order feature in the development branch will be available via scaffolding early on <b>April 6, 2021</b>.
I will update this Blogpost with every release and checkout change.
</Callout>

Before we get started to build a static Payment Method.
Let's briefly look at how the Checkout Process works in PWA Studio.
So basically, this is a foundation to describe which components exist and how we can use them.


**CheckoutPage/CheckoutPage.js**

This component is the main entry point for the one-step Checkout.
It renders sections according to the state created by `useCheckoutPage`.

Steps Nummer for section state:
```js:title=peregrine/lib/talons/CheckoutPage/useCheckoutPage.js
export const CHECKOUT_STEP = {
    SHIPPING_ADDRESS: 1,
    SHIPPING_METHOD: 2,
    PAYMENT: 3,
    REVIEW: 4
};
```


**PaymentInformation/paymentInformation.js**

The checkout page will display the component on the checkout step **PAYMENT**.

It  responsible for:
* `LoadingIndicator/indicator.js` on load
* `PaymentInformation/summary.js` if doneEditing=true
* `PaymentInformation/paymentMethods.js` if doneEditing=false

**PaymentInformation/paymentMethods.js**

Loads all available Payments via usePaymentMethods hook and compares them with `paymentMethodCollection.js`,
built via Magento Target. It only renders components that both lists contain.


**PaymentInformation/summary.js**

Renders information for the ReviewStep

## Checkout Payment Extension point

To extend the Checkout with a new Payment Method we can use a venia target for the `paymentMethodCollection.js`.

> If you are not familiar with targets and how that works,
[Getting started with PWA Studio Extensibility](https://larsroettig.dev/getting-started-with-pwa-studio-extensibility) describes the foundation concept.

  alt="Image that show PWA Studio Checkout"
/>

In the Image, we can see the billing address is by design part of the
payment methods to allow special implementation.

<Callout type={'info'}>
<b>Note:</b> In default Magento, you need to make sure that the billing address
is set by before you can complete the order.
</Callout>

For 90% of all Payment Methods, the billing address form would be identical. In the current  `develop` branch, you can find  `@magento/venia-ui/lib/components/CheckoutPage/BillingAddress`. You can copy it to start already building your Payment Method.



```js:title=intercept.js
module.exports = (targets) => {
  const { specialFeatures } = targets.of("@magento/pwa-buildpack");
    /**
     *  Wee need to activate esModules, cssModules and GQL Queries to allow build pack to load our extension
     * {@link https://magento.github.io/pwa-studio/pwa-buildpack/reference/configure-webpack/#special-flags}.
     */
  specialFeatures.tap((flags) => {
    flags[targets.name] = {
      esModules: true,
      cssModules: true,
      graphqlQueries: true,
    };
  });

   /** Registers our Payment **/
  const { checkoutPagePaymentTypes } = targets.of("@magento/venia-ui");
  checkoutPagePaymentTypes.tap((payments) =>
    payments.add({
      paymentCode: "payment-code",
      importPath: "@your-namespace/components/payment.js",
    })
  );
};
```

Your payment component gets the following props injected by the parent.

```jsx
<YourPaymentMethodComponent
  onPaymentSuccess={onPaymentSuccess}
  onPaymentError={onPaymentError}
  resetShouldSubmit={resetShouldSubmit}
  shouldSubmit={shouldSubmit}
/>;
```

* `onPaymentSuccess:`
Callback Methode should call to proceed to review step.
If the Payment method needs a token (nonce), you need to take that
was generated successfully before calling this method.

* `onPaymentError:`
Callback to invoke when the payment component throws an errors

* `resetShouldSubmit:`
Callback to reset the review order button flag

* `shouldSubmit (read-only):`
It will change to true if the review button gets summited.
